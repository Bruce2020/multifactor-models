SHARPE'S SINGLE FACTOR MODEL:
This model is created in an attempt to decompose the returns on a specific asset between alpha, the residual return, and the return correlated with the general excess return from the market.  Our experiment begins by creating the single factor model for a variety of etf stocks and the s&p500.
