# A Survey of Multi-Factor Models
<br><br>
SHARPE'S SINGLE FACTOR MODEL:
This model is created in an attempt to decompose the returns on a specific asset between alpha, the residual return, and the return correlated with the general excess return from the market.  Our experiment begins by creating the single factor model for a variety of stocks in the S&P telecom select industry index.
